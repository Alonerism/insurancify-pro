# Frontend Integration Status

## âœ… Completed
- **React Query Setup**: Added @tanstack/react-query with QueryClient configuration
- **API Client**: Created comprehensive API client (`src/lib/api.ts`) with all backend endpoints
- **Custom Hooks**: Built React Query hooks (`src/hooks/useApi.ts`) for data fetching and mutations
- **Environment Config**: Added `.env` with backend URL configuration
- **Core Pages Updated**:
  - âœ… Dashboard: Real KPIs, alerts, renewals, coverage stats
  - âœ… Assignment Matrix: Live buildings, agents, policies with CRUD operations
  - âœ… Properties: Real property data with policy counts and coverage
  - âœ… Policies: Full CRUD with filters, file upload, policy history tabs, inline notes
  - âœ… Compare: Real data integration, policy vs policy, building vs building, prospective comparisons
  - âœ… Claims: Demo implementation using alerts as proxy (needs backend claims endpoints)
- **Global Search**: Implemented in header with live search results
- **File Upload**: PDF upload with parsing integration on policy detail pages  
- **Policy History**: Timeline with notes and document attachments
- **Error Handling**: Added loading states and error boundaries for failed API calls
- **Toast Notifications**: Integrated success/error feedback for user actions

## ðŸ”„ Backend Integration Needed
- **Claims Management**: No claims endpoints found in backend - currently using alerts as proxy
- **AI Features**: Compare page shows "AI Disabled" - needs OPENAI_API_KEY configuration
- **Advanced File Operations**: Some file management features marked as "Coming Soon"

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details
- **Backend URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- **API Documentation**: Available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- **Query Caching**: 5-minute stale time for most queries
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry (2x) for failed requests
- **Loading States**: Comprehensive loading UI throughout app
- **Search Integration**: Global search bar with real-time results

## ðŸš€ Features Completed
- âœ… Real-time dashboard with live KPIs
- âœ… Drag-and-drop assignment matrix
- âœ… Policy CRUD with advanced filtering
- âœ… File upload with PDF parsing
- âœ… Policy history with inline notes
- âœ… Global search across all entities
- âœ… Building and agent management
- âœ… Policy comparison tools
- âœ… Error handling and loading states

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (Backend Dependent)
1. Add dedicated claims endpoints to backend
2. Configure OPENAI_API_KEY for AI features
3. Add any missing file management endpoints
4. Implement user authentication if needed

**Status**: Frontend integration is complete and fully functional with the current backend API. All major features are working with real data.
